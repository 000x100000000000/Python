# Sum of digits in a string

# This program asks the user to enter a series of single-digit
# numbers with nothing separating them. The program will display
# the sum of all the single digit numbers in the sting. If the
# user enters 2514, the method should return 12, which is the
# sum of 2, 5, 1 and 4.

def main():

    total = 0

    number = input("Enter the number: ")

    print("You entered: ", end='')

    number.split()

    print(len(number))
